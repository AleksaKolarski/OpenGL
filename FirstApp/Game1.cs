            //We've got the vertices done, but how exactly should this be converted to pixels for the final image?
            //To decide this, we must create what are known as shaders; these are small programs that live on the graphics card, and transform the vertices into pixels.

            shader = new Shader("shader.vert", "shader.frag");

            //Now, enable the shader.
            //Just like the VBO, this is global, so every function that modifies a shader will modify this one until a new one is bound instead.

            //While this makes them incredibly flexible, it means we have to specify how that data will be mapped to the shader's input variables.

            //To do this, we use the GL.VertexAttribPointer function
            //Arguments:
            //  Location of the input variable in the shader. the layout(location = 0) line in the vertex shader explicitly sets it to 0.
            //  How many elements will be sent to the variable. In this case, 3 floats for every vertex.
            //  The data type of the elements set, in this case float.
            //  Whether or not the data should be converted to normalized device coordinates. In this case, false, because that's already done.
            //  The stride; this is how many bytes are between the last element of one vertex and the first element of the next. 3 * sizeof(float) in this case.
            //  The offset; this is how many bytes it should skip to find the first element of the first vertex. 0 as of right now.
            //Stride and Offset are just sort of glossed over for now, but when we get into texture coordinates they'll be shown in better detail.

            //For a simple project, this would probably be enough. However, if you have a bunch of objects with their own shaders being drawn, it would be incredibly
            //tedious to do this over and over again every time you need to switch what object is being drawn. Because of this, OpenGL now *requires* that you create
            //what is known as a Vertex Array Object (VAO). This stores the layout you create with VertexAttribPointer/EnableVertexAttribArray so that it can be
            //recreated with one simple function call.
            //By creating the VertexArrayObject, it has automatically saved this layout, so you can simply bind the VAO again to get everything back how it should be.

            //Finally, we bind the VBO again so that the VAO will bind that as well.
            //This means that, when you bind the VAO, it will automatically bind the VBO as well.

            //However, we only modify the color, so ColorBufferBit is all we need to clear.
            GL.Clear(ClearBufferMask.ColorBufferBit);
